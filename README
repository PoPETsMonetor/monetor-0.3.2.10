Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository (install autoconf first):
 
sh autogen.sh && ./configure --disable-asciidoc

 If failed, install any missing library (probably things like libevent-dev and
libssl-dev) and call the script again. Then:

make && make install

This is a fork from Tor version 0.3.2.10 with some bugfixing cherry-picked
commits that appeared later. The core of our features are inside
src/or/mt_[].c/h files, but other modifications and adjustments live in many
original source files.


Note! It might be possible that in the future, library such as libssl-dev or
libevent-dev won't be compatible to the current fonction prototype used from
them. If you end-up to this case, ./configure allows to specify static
dependencies (./configure --help) to build with static libraries: just download
the library version around the release date of this code, and that should work
fine :-)
