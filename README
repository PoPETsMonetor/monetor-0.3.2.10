Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository (install autoconf first):
 
sh autogen.sh && ./configure --disable-asciidoc

 If failed, install any missing library (probably things like libevent-dev and
libssl-dev) and call the script again. Then:

make && make install

This is a fork from Tor version 0.3.2.10 with some bugfixing cherry-picked
commits that appeared later. The core of our features are inside
src/or/mt_[].c/h files, but other modifications and adjustments live in many
original source files. Most of the payment logic is implemented within
src/or/mt_[].c/h files, and separated for each role in the payment protocol. So,
the logic is one controller file and one payment handling file for each role.
E.g., src/or/mt_cclient.c and src/or/mt_cpay.c. The first is the controler that
interfaces the payment layer to the payment cryptography, the second hold the
crypto logic to make payments. Only function from the controllers are expected
to be called from other places in the Tor code base.


Note! It might be possible that in the future, library such as libssl-dev or
libevent-dev won't be compatible to the current fonction prototype used from
them. If you end-up to this case, ./configure allows to specify static
dependencies (./configure --help) to build with static libraries: just download
the library version around the release date of this code, and that should work
fine :-)

In a much further future, it might be possible that the libc would not be
compatible, or that other library problems appear. Running this code over a
Debian 8, or Ubuntu 16 should guarantee to remove those issues.
